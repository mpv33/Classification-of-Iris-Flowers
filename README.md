# Classification-of-Iris-Flowers
This project can be developed using a supervised method like support vector method of machine learning. The dataset of Irish flowers has numeric attributes, i.e., sepal and petal length and width. As a beginner, you need to figure out how to utilize the data.
# Highlights of the Project
The Iris flower dataset is small and no need to do pre-processing.
You can download this Iris flower dataset from here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.
To classify the flowers into among the three species â€“ virginica, setosa, or versicolor is the task of this machine learning project.
